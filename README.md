## Hops

Hops lets you preview compiled iOS applications in Quick Look.

![Screenshot showing Quick Look preview of an iPhone application called Coatcheck, version 1.0, listing the application identifier, the push message environment, debugging, a list of permitted devices, and keychain access groups](http://f.cl.ly/items/04242J2K17370j0w3A15/Screen%20Shot%202014-06-15%20at%2016.28.32.png)

At present, it will display previews for exported IPAs (`.ipa`) and Xcode build archives (`.xcarchive`).

You can use it to preflight IPAs, to make sure the correct provisoning profile was used during compilation, and to check that the desired device UDIDs are permitted. You can also use it to determine which of a list of seemingly identical archived builds contains the specific version you want.

Currently, it displays the application's name, version, unique identifier, the APNS environment (if any), whether debugging is permitted (AKA `get-task-allow`), what device UDIDs the application is permitted to run on, and the keychain access groups accessible by the application.

Displaying supported Universal architectures (ARMv7, ARMv7s, etc.) and supported hardware (via `UIRequiredDeviceCapabilities`) is planned.

## Installation

### Download

[Download the latest version](http://www.philcalvin.com/downloads/hops-0.2.qlgenerator.zip), unzip it if necessary, and install it by following these steps:

1. Open the Library by opening Finder, holding the Option key, and choosing **Go - Library** in the menu.
2. Double-click the **QuickLook** folder.
3. Drag **Hops Viewer.qlgenerator** here.

### Building from source

First, clone this repository.

#### Using Xcode (GUI)

2. Open **Hops.xcworkspace** (not Hops.xcodeproj) in Xcode 5.
3. Choose **Product - Build** from the menu.
4. Show the Project Navigator by pressing âŒ˜-1.
5. Expand the **Products** group by clicking the arrow.
6. Control-click (or right-click) **Hops Viewer.qlgenerator** and choose **Show in Finder**.
1. Open the Library by opening Finder, holding the Option key, and choosing **Go - Library** in the menu.
2. Double-click the **QuickLook** folder.
3. Drag **Hops Viewer.qlgenerator** here.

#### Using xcodebuild

From the root of this repository, run:

    xcodebuild -target "Hops Viewer"
    mv "build/Release/Hops Viewer.qlgenerator" ~/Library/QuickLook


## Development

Hops is broken into a dynamic library (called Hops) and a Quick Look generator that uses this library (called Hops Viewer.) There is no runnable build target -- just use the test suite, or install the built `.qlgenerator` for interactive testing.

You may need to run `qlmanage -r` to forcibly reload the Quick Look generators after installing a new version.

`NSLog` statements in Hops or Hops Viewer can be viewed using Console.app, available in `/Applications/Utilities`.

## Tests

You can run the test suite from Xcode using **Product - Test** in the menu or from the command line:

    hops $ xcodebuild -scheme Hops test
